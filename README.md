PocketAces is an app for the CS117 project that allows users to play Nertz and Blackjac with a friend over a Bluetooth connection. Upon opening the app, enter your name and select one of the two games (the same as your friend). Press the Bluetooth button in the top right corner and choose your friend's device. Now play the game, and you will be connected to your friend's phone.
